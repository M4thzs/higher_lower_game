# Higher Lower Game - Instagram Edition

## About the Project

This is a game inspired by the "Higher Lower Game," where the player must guess which Instagram profile has more followers. The game is based on a predefined list of the most-followed accounts on the platform.

## How It Works

1. The program displays two random Instagram profiles.
2. The player must choose which one has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B'.
3. If the answer is correct, the game continues, and the score increases.
4. If the player is wrong, the game ends, and the final score is displayed.
5. The player can choose to play again at the end of each round.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Random Library** (for randomly selecting profiles)
